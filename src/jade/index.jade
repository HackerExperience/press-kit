            | Hacker Experience 2 is based on 
            a(href="https://legacy.hackerexperience.com") Hacker Experience 1 (HE1)
            | , released on September 2014. It currently has around 500,000 players and an overall positive review.

          +text
            | However, HE1 is Renato's first work, built while he was in college, and has several design flaws. It also has a simple text-based interface. Hacker Experience 2 was built to solve these issues and provide an even better game.
