        p
          | The people behind Hacker Experience have a not-so-secret agenda. 
          a(href="#") See the full list.

        h3 Computer Science education
        p
          | We want to spread Computer Science education to young students
          | around the world, with the ultimate goal of getting them
          | interested in Computer Science.
        p
          | By playing the game, non-technical players will learn concepts of
          | computer networks, operating systems and security. We want them to
          | know about VPN, HTTPS and encryption to protect their privacy.
        p
          | Outside the game, we aim to motivate non-technical players and
          | students to contribute to open-source projects for the first time.

        h3 Demystifying open source
        p
          | Contributing to a project tends to be hard and intimidating,
          | specially for first-time contributors. It also tends to be
          | exclusive to programmers or geeks. We want to change this reality.

        h3 A game for everyone
        p
          | We want to create a game for everyone, including those with
          | disabilities. With help from the community, we plan to develop
          | special interfaces crafted for them. 
        p
          | Ultimately, we want to give people like 
          a(href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/boy-11-says-first-words-96160") Jemil 
          | and 
          a(href="http://www.bbc.com/news/disability-35705489") James 
          | the chance to play a game made for them.

        h3 Free and open source software
        p
          | Hacker Experience 2 is a free and open source software being
          | developed openly. This means the entire codebase that powers HE2
          | is public. Users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study,
          | change and improve the software.

        h3 Let's build a game
        p
          | We welcome players and students to contribute to Hacker Experience
          | 2. It's also a great opportunity for them to take the first step
          | on programming.
        p
          | Having the opportunity to 
          strong submit a small improvement 
          | to a game that person actually plays can have a tremendous effect.
          | Seeing the change being rolled out to others brings a great
          | feeling that, we hope, will motivate further contributions.
        p
          | We believe this 
          strong practical experience 
          | will get more students interested in Computer Science, computer
          | programming and open source projects. 

      #history
        h2 History
        p
          | Hacker Experience 2 is based on 
          a(href="https://legacy.hackerexperience.com") Hacker Experience 1 (HE1)
          | , released on September 2014. It currently has around 500,000
          | players and an overall positive review.
        p
          | However, HE1 is Renato's first work, built while he was in
          | college, and has several design flaws. It also has a simple
          | text-based interface. Hacker Experience 2 was built to solve these
          | issues and provide an even better game.
